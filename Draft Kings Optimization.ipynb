    "Here we read the data into a pandas dataframe. If you are not familiar with pandas data frames you can check out the official documentation 10 min introduction here: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html. In Draft Kings, there is a constraint to how many players at each position you can have on your team, so we need a method to represent this in our optimization model. Here we do this by adding binary variables for each position QB, RB, WR, TE, or DST. A _1_ for that variable would represent that the player can be drafted at that position, and a _0_ otherwise. A player can only be drafted for one position type. Also the `Salary` variable is converted from an integer to a float for consistency."
